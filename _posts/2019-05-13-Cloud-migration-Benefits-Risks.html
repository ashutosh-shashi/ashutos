    Cloud migration is the process of partially or completely transitioning application, 
    data or any business component to a cloud computing environment. There can be three 
    types of cloud migration, first, migrate application and data from on-premises data 
    center to the cloud. Second, is reverse of the first, migrate application and data 
    back to the on-premise data center. And third, migrate application and data from 
    one cloud provider to another cloud provider.
</p>
<p>
    In this blog I will talk about the benefits and risks of the first type of cloud 
    migration, that is the migration of data and application from on-site to the cloud.
</p>
<h3 class="section-heading">Benefits:</h3>
<p>
    Fast-growing organizations migrate to the cloud to keep the pace of their growth.
    Below are the main benefits of migration application and data from on-premise to cloud.
</p>
<p>
    <b>Scalability</b>: Scalability is one of the big reason for the success of cloud computing. 
    In the on-premise data center, it is difficult to scale resource on the fly to cater 
    to growing demands.
</p>
<p>
    <b>Cost Efficient</b>: Organizations do not have to spend a huge amount of money on data 
    center maintenance, capacity planning, and hardware. You will have a choice of 
    control level of infrastructure with as-a-service options, like IaaS, PaaS, SaaS, FaaS.
</p>
<p>
    <b>Efficiency and agility</b>: Cloud computing enables organizations to get their product 
    to the market with speed. Cloud-based application and data can be accessed from 
    anywhere with any internet-connected device.
</p>
<p>
    <b>Focus on business</b>: Instead of capacity planning and data center maintenance, 
    an organization can focus on its core business so that its growth can be accelerated.
</p>
<h3 class="section-heading">Risks:</h3>
<p>
    There are risks involved in cloud migration, it is very important to identify 
    if any risk is involved in migration. Some risks are as below.
</p>
<p>
    The complexity of the existing system: Assessment of complexity of the current 
    application and finding out all the dependencies of that application is equally 
    important for a successful migration to the cloud. If the application is very 
    complex and working perfectly fine in on-premise, traffic is constant and 
    predicted to be constant or having liner growth, you may think twice before 
    deciding it to migrate to the cloud. You should also check eligibility of 
    application to migrate to the cloud. The application may face latency issue after 
    moving to cloud because microservices will communicate over the network. It is very 
    important to know what it takes to modernize application to work in the cloud.
</p>
<p>
    <b>Security</b>: When you are migrating sensitive data, you may not have full control 
    of your data. Also because of compliance requirements, you may not choose to store 
    sensitive data in the cloud.
</p>
<p>
    Vendor lock-in: When a customer uses proprietary product and services provided by a 
    cloud vendor and can not migrate back to the on-premise or cannot switch to another 
    vendor product and applications easily is known as vendor lock-in. To avoid vendor 
    lock-in client should negotiate entry and exit strategy with cloud vendor during a 
    migration strategy.
