<p>New switch expressions will be available as preview feature is JDK 12.</p>
<h3 class="section-heading">What is a preview feature?</h3>
<p>
    Preview features are available for those who want to use those feature before its final 
    release of JDK. You can use preview feature if you have enabled it for JDK 12, by 
    default it will not be available for you.
</p>
<p>Below is how preview features are defined by OpenJDK:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
    A preview language or VM feature is a new feature of the Java SE Platform that is fully 
    specified, fully implemented, and yet impermanent. It is available in a JDK feature 
    release to provoke developer feedback based on real-world use; this may lead to it 
    becoming permanent in the future Java SE Platform.
</blockquote>
<p>
    It is a fully implemented feature, released first for developer feedback. It will be 
    not experimental, high quality and universally available. This preview feature will 
    be available to enable it to compile and run time.
</p>
<p>
    To enable it at compile time by using –enable-preview as below:
</p>
<code>
        javac --release 12 --enable-preview Foo.java  // Enable all preview features of Java SE 12        
</code>
<p>and to enable it at run time as below: </p>
<code>
    java --enable-preview -jar App.jar  // Enable all preview features of Java SE 12
</code>
<h3 class="section-heading">The current switch Statement in Java: </h3>
<p>
    Currently, Java is having a switch statement very similar to C or C++ language. It has many case: and break; statements. If you will miss any break statement then your program will not work correctly.
</p>
<pre> 
<code>
        switch (subject) {
            case PHYSICS:
            case CHEMISTRY:
            case BIOLOGY:
                System.out.println("Science");
                break;
            case GEOGRAPHY:
            case HISTORY:
            case POL_SCIENCE:
                System.out.println("social Sciences");
                break;
        }
</code>
</pre>
<h3 class="section-heading">The newly proposed switch statements in JDK 12:</h3>
<p>
    The new proposed switch statement for JDK 12 can compute a value or can execute a 
    statement that will match with a case.
</p>
<p>
    To compute a value now break can have a value that it will return. Break statement 
    without a value is similar to the old version of switch statement defined above.
</p>
<p>
    Below is the example mentioned in JDK 12 can have a break statement with value, 
    this is the implementation of switch that can compute a value:
</p>

<pre>
    <code>
            int result = switch (s) {
                case "Foo": 
                    break 1;
                case "Bar":
                    break 2;
                default:
                    System.out.println("Neither Foo nor Bar, hmmm...");
                    break 0;
            };
    </code>
</pre>
<p>
    in the above example, the result will be the value break will have at the time of 
    executing a break statement.
</p>
<p>
    The new switch statement is also proposed to add a new “simplified” form, 
    with new “case L ->” switch labels.
</p>
<pre>
    <code>
            switch (k) {
                case 1 -> System.out.println("one");
                case 2 -> System.out.println("two");
                case 3 -> System.out.println("many");
            }
    </code>
</pre>
<p>
    It can have a default case as well:
</p>
<pre>
    <code>
            switch (k) {
                case 1 -> System.out.println("one");
                case 2 -> System.out.println("two");
                case 3 -> System.out.println("many");
              default -> System.out.println("default");
            }
    </code>
</pre>
<p>
    This is very similar to the earlier switch statement, but a break statement is not 
    needed here. We can use new “case L →” labels to get computed values as well as below:
</p>
<pre>
    <code>
            int numLetters = switch (day) {
                case MONDAY, FRIDAY, SUNDAY -> 6;
                case TUESDAY                -> 7;
                case THURSDAY, SATURDAY     -> 8;
                case WEDNESDAY              -> 9;
            };
            
            Here numLetters value is dependent on the case executed.
    </code>
</pre>
<p>
    If we need multi-line statement for each case then we can have {} block. If we need 
    multi-line statement but need computed value out of switch statement then we have to 
    use the break statement to return a value similar to earlier example returning value 
    through break statement using new “case L →” labels. Below is the example quoted 
    by JDK 12:
</p>
<pre>
    <code>
            int j = switch (day) {
                case MONDAY  -> 0;
                case TUESDAY -> 1;
                default      -> {
                    int k = day.toString().length();
                    int result = f(k);
                    break result;
                }
            };
    </code>
</pre>
<p>
    In either format of case labels, the new “case L →” labels or “case L:” labels, 
    if it is non-void switch, that returns a value, it must be complete with a value 
    or throw an exception. A switch statement cannot be a combination of void and a 
    non-void switch labels. Below switch statements are incorrect:
</p>
<pre>
    <code>
            int i = switch (day) {
                case MONDAY -> {
                    System.out.println("Monday"); 
                    // ERROR! Block doesn't contain a break with value
                }
                default -> 1;
            };
            i = switch (day) {
                case MONDAY, TUESDAY, WEDNESDAY: 
                    break 0;
                default: 
                    System.out.println("Second half of the week");
                    // ERROR! Group doesn't contain a break with value
            };
    </code>
</pre>
<p>
    Also as per JDK 12 new switch statement proposal, control statements, break, return 
    and continue, cannot jump through a switch expression, such as in the following:
</p>
<pre>
    <code>
            int k = switch (e) { 
                case 0:  
                    break 1;
                case 1:
                    break 2;
                default: 
                    continue z; 
                    // ERROR! Illegal jump through a switch expression 
            };
    </code>
</pre>
<p>
    In JDK 12, they may expand switch to support switching on primitive types (and their 
    box types) that have previously been disallowed, such as float, double, and long.
</p>
<p>
    I think these new switch feature will increase the usability of the switch statement.
