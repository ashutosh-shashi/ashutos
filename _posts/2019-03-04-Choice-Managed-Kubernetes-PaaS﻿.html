<p>If you want your cloud provider should take more responsibility and you 
    can focus on your core business (code), in this case, the first thing that 
    comes in mind is PaaS.</p>

<p>PaaS is great, you just have to manage your code, that is what your core expertise is. 
    Cloud provider is responsible for almost everything else.</p>

<p>PaaS, as defined by NIST, is:</p>

<blockquote class="blockquote"> The capability provided to the consumer 
    is to deploy onto the cloud infrastructure consumer-created or acquired 
    applications created using programming languages, libraries, services, and 
    tools supported by the provider. The consumer does not manage or control the 
    underlying cloud infrastructure including network, servers, operating systems, 
    or storage, but has control over the deployed applications and possibly 
    configuration settings for the application-hosting environment.</blockquote>

<p>Cloud providers come with an approach that how to run the application 
    on PaaS to get maximum benefit, the most discussed approach is 
    the <a href="https://12factor.net/" target="_blank">12-factor</a> 
    approach referred by Cloud Foundry. After going through all the benefits of 
    the PaaS, a strong opinion about PaaS builds up in mind and feel like this 
    is the best solution for deploying the application without any overhead. 
    This is true if you are developing a new application from scratch. 
    This is most suited to the web application or mobile application you are 
    planning to build.</p>

<p>If you already have an application running on your hardware and you are planning 
    to move to the cloud, in that case, is PaaS a good option? You have analyzed effort 
    of refactoring and you are ready to do refactoring of your application to move 
    it to PaaS. But you want to try first and you are not sure which cloud provider 
    you will choose, that could be AWS, Azure, IBM, GCP or any other cloud. In that case, 
    you have to evaluate the cloud platform and decide cloud vendor first before start 
    refactoring.</p>

<p>You have decided to use third-party PaaS like Cloud Foundry or Openshift, 
    so that you may be open for any cloud vendor. By using independent 
    open source PaaS, you will have the flexibility to move your application 
    to any underline IaaS provided by public cloud vendor or own infrastructure 
    that is a private cloud. In this case, you are not locking with any IaaS, 
    but you may still have possibly getting locked with vendors like Cloud Foundry 
    or Openshift.</p>

<p>To move existing applications to cloud with minimum infrastructure responsibility, 
    Managed Kubernetes is the best solution. Kubernetes is an open source system for 
    automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. 
    Managed Kubernetes is a managed service that managed nodes (Instances) of the 
    cluster where containers are running inside pods. Kubernetes can scale without 
    having much burden on the ops team. Kubernetes is a management framework for the 
    container in an IaaS, and Managed Kubernetes is a managed service that allows the 
    user to deploy their code in a container in the provided platform by cloud vendors.</p>

<p>Managed Kubernetes is a “Kubernetes as a Service” that simplifies deployment and you 
    can focus on development. Fully managed Kubernetes is being provided by almost all 
    cloud vendor, as this is an open source solution, you can switch to any vendor any 
    time without any issue.</p>

<p>Managed Kubernetes Service advantage:</p>
<ul>
    <li>You can focus on your core business.</li>
    <li>You will not run your application in underlying VM using PaaS, instead, 
        you will run your application in containers using Kubernetes service.</li>
    <li>Managed Kubernetes service can run on your on-premises, any public cloud, 
        the mix of public and private cloud.</li>
    <li>It can run on your laptop, on your data center, and on the public cloud.</li>
    <li>Self-healing infrastructure.</li>
    <li>No vendor lock-in traps.</li>
    <li>Easy audit and log aggregation.</li>
    <li>It provides one-click deployment similar to PaaS (or can be deployed with one command).</li>
</ul>

<p>There are many hosted solutions available for Managed Kubernetes Engine, some of them are:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Amazon Elastic Container Service for Kubernetes (EKS).</li>
    <li>Azure Kubernetes Service</li>
    <li>IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service</li>
    <li>VMware Cloud PKS</li>
    <li>Google Kubernetes Engine</li>
    <li>DigitalOcean Kubernetes</li>
    <li>Oracle Container Engine for Kubernetes</li>
</ul>
